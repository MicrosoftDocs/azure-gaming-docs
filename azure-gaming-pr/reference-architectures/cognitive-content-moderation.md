# Content Moderation Reference Architecture

Not everyone behaves appropriately while they are playing online, and some **moderation** is needed to maintain a civil, welcoming, and pleasurable experience amongst the players. By detecting inappropriate messaging content generated by the community and pruning or deleting it before it is shown to the public view, you can help achieve this goal.

This article will describe the architecture used in [this sample on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/gaming-cognitive-services-content-moderation). Keep in mind that the code from this reference architecture is only an example for guidance and there may be places to optimize the code before using in a production environment.

## Architecture Diagram

## Architecture Services

- [Content Moderator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/content-moderator/overview) - Checks text, image, and video content for material that is potentially offensive, risky, or otherwise undesirable. When such material is found, the service applies appropriate labels (flags) to the content.
- [Azure Traffic Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) - When scaling across multiple regions globally, this service selects the closest region to connect to via DNS.
- [Event Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/) - A service tailored for real-time receiving and processing of a large number of events (chat strings in this case), in order, with little configuration or management overhead.
- [Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) - Serverless compute service to run code on-demand -- in this case, code that invokes the different Cognitive Services.

## Architecture considerations

You only need to create a single Event Hub namespace that will contain the 2 Event Hubs used for sending and receiving messages, respectively.

The Azure Content Moderator detects profanity (masked or not) and PII. It supports several content types: [text](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/content-moderator/text-moderation-api), [images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/content-moderator/image-moderation-api) and [videos](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/content-moderator/video-moderation-human-review). Text is the only content type covered in this architecture.

## Deployment template

Click the following button to deploy the project to your Azure subscription:

[![Deploy to Azure](media/deploytoazure.svg)](https://aka.ms/arm-gaming-cognitive-services-content-moderation)

This operation will trigger a template deployment of the [azuredeploy.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/gaming-cognitive-services-content-moderation/blob/master/azuredeploy.json) ARM template file to your Azure subscription, which will create the necessary Azure resources. This may induce charges in your Azure account.

Have a look at the [general guidelines documentation](./general-guidelines.md#naming-conventions) that includes a section summarizing the naming rules and restrictions for Azure services.

>[!NOTE]
> If you're interested in how the ARM template works, review the Azure Resource Manager template documentation from each of the different services leveraged in this reference architecture:
>
> - [Create an Event Hub using Azure Resource Manager template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-resource-manager-namespace-event-hub)
> - [Automate resource deployment for your function app in Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-infrastructure-as-code)

There are two types of Azure Cognitive Services subscriptions. The first is a subscription to a single service, such as Computer Vision or the Speech Services. A single-service subscription is restricted to just that service. The second type is a multi-service subscription. This allows you to use a single subscription for multiple Azure Cognitive Services. This option also consolidates billing. To make this reference architecture as modular as possible, the cognitive services are each setup as a single service.

Finally, add these Function [application settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings) so the sample project can connect to the Azure services:

- EVENTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING = The [connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string) to the Azure Event Hub namespace that was created
- CONTENTMODERATOR_KEY - The [access key](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings) used to access the Azure Content Moderator Cognitive Service that was created

>[!TIP]
> To run the Azure Functions locally, update the *local.settings.json* file with these same app settings.

## Step by Step

1. The player's device opens a persistent and encrypted connection to the chat server in a specific region determined by **Azure Traffic Manager**. The chat server creates a process responsible for maintaining connectivity with the player along with some basic metadata.
1. The player's client sends a chat message to the chat server over the secure connection previously created. The player's process in the chat server receives the message, decrypts it, and parses it.
1. Standard validations are run, and the chat server calls the **Azure Event Hub** service, as it keeps the message order.
1. The **Azure Event Hub** serves as an input trigger for an **Azure Function**.
1. The Azure Function invokes the **Azure Content Moderator** service, that reviews the message sent by the player and returns a result.
1. Another **Azure Event Hub** is set as the output for the **Azure Function**.
1. The chat server receives the message from the **Azure Event Hub**.
1. Optionally the chat server saves both the original message and the outcome from the **Azure Content Moderator** service in persistent storage like **Azure Data Lake Storage**.
1. If the message was stored, it can be optionally saved into **Azure Data Lake Analytics** for analysis purposes.
1. The result from the **Azure Content Moderator** service is then sent to the recipient player's process in the chat server. The process runs further validations on the message, serializes it and sends it to the recipient player's devices over their secure connection.

### Azure Event Hubs

See this [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-dotnet-framework-getstarted-send) for a simple implementation for sending an event to an Event Hub in multiple programming languages.  Some additional samples are available [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs/tree/master/samples).

### Function triggered by an Azure Event Hub to another Azure Event Hub

When an [Event Hubs trigger Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-hubs#trigger) is triggered, the message that triggers it is passed into the Function as a string. Use the [Event Hubs output binding](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-hubs#output) to write events to an event stream.

```csharp
[return: EventHub("ehigce-output", Connection = "EventHubConnectionAppSetting")]
    public static string Run([EventHubTrigger("ehigce-input", Connection = "EventHubConnectionAppSetting")] string chatString, ILogger log)
```

## Security considerations

Do not hard-code any Event Hub or Cognitive Services connection strings into the source of the Function.  Instead, at a minimum, leverage the [Function App Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#manage-app-service-settings) or, for even stronger security, use [Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/) instead. There is a tutorial explaining how to [create a Key Vault](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/benjaminperkins/2018/06/13/create-an-azure-key-vault-and-secret/), how to [use a managed service identity with a Function](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/benjaminperkins/2018/06/13/using-managed-service-identity-msi-with-and-azure-app-service-or-an-azure-function/) and finally how to [read the secret stored in Key Vault from a Function](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/benjaminperkins/2018/06/13/how-to-connect-to-a-database-from-an-azure-function-using-azure-key-vault/).

Review the [Event Hub authentication and security model overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-authentication-and-security-model-overview) and put it into practice to ensure only your chat server can talk to the Event Hub.

## Scaling

There are two points that could become a bottleneck in this architecture that you should plan for:

1. Cognitive Services scale well but they are throttled by default. Reach out to Azure support if you are planning to make use of them in large scale to increase capacity.
1. The chat server receiving the Azure Event Hub responses will need to scale. Spin up enough virtual machines to address the demand.

## Alternatives

You could consider leveraging [Azure Cache for Redis](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview) and [Azure Databricks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-databricks/what-is-azure-databricks) if you are interested in gathering analytics using an Apache Spark-based platform.

## Pricing

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://aka.ms/azfreegamedev) to get started with 12 months of free services. You're not charged for services included for free with Azure free account, unless you exceed the limits of these services. Learn how to check usage through the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-check-free-service-usage#check-usage-on-the-azure-portal) or through the [usage file](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-check-free-service-usage#check-usage-through-the-usage-file).

You are responsible for the cost of the Azure services used while running these reference architectures.  The total amount will vary based on usage. See the pricing webpages for each of the services that were used in the reference architecture:

- [Azure Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/traffic-manager/)
- [Azure Event Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/event-hubs/)
- [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/)
- [Azure Content Moderator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/content-moderator/)

You can also use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to configure and estimate the costs for the Azure services that you are planning to use.
